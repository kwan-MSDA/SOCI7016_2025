    "text": "Academic honesty and plagiarism\nThe university has high expectations for ethical conduct among students. Students must always pursue academic honesty in their studies, as this is a condition for authentic learning and creative intellectual contributions. Committing the following (including but not limited to) dishonest behaviour is unacceptable in any circumstances:\n\nPlagiarism (i.e. use of other people’s work without proper acknowledgement);\nSubmitting an assignment that is not the student’s own work, including the use of prior students’ work\nForgery of any document or certificate\n\nPlease be reminded that disciplinary actions in connection with the violation of academic honesty may result in serious consequences. Plagiarism may be handled by the individual teacher or reported to the University Disciplinary Committee.\n\nResources:\n\nHKU Teaching & Learning – Plagiarism\nHKU Online Learning – Information Literacy Training: Academic Honesty\n\nIn this class, we will use AI tools, including ChatGPT, that harness large language models as pedagogical opportunities for learning and teaching in the course. Doing so will align with one of our course goals, which pertains to the evaluation of arguments and justification with evidence.\nOur class agreement will follow the University’s Policy on Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Teaching and Learning, which notes that “students who fail to make a full declaration and proper citation according to the course requirements may face disciplinary action”.\nFor this class, all submitted work should be written in your own words. Just as you cannot take credit for others’ writing in your assignments, you cannot use paraphrasing software (“spinbots”) or AI writing software (like ChatGPT) and submit the output as your own. Doing so in this is a violation of the University’s Policy on Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Teaching and Learning, which notes that “students who fail to make a full declaration and proper citation according to the course requirements may face disciplinary action”. At the beginning of the semester, we will identify examples of AI tools and discuss what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, and academic dishonesty. This will help to ensure that we are all on the same page about the policies for this course and how they connect to our learning outcomes.\nCourse privacy statement As noted in the Department’s Guidelines on the recording of lectures and teaching sessions, students may not audio or video record class meetings without permission from the instructor (and guest speakers, when applicable). If the instructor grants permission or if the teaching team posts videos themselves, students may keep recordings only for personal use and may not post recordings on the Internet, or otherwise distribute them. These policies protect the privacy rights of instructors and students, and the intellectual property and other rights of the university. Students who need lectures recorded for the purposes of an academic accommodation should contact CEDARS Special Educational Needs (SEN) Support."
