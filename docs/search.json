First, a good command of the conceptual foundations of statistics is essential to understand why social scientists analyze data in some specific ways. Second, a hands-on experience in the computing and programming tools (R in our course) to both manage and analyze data is crucial to be able to apply the conceptual foundations of statistics to real-world data."

No matter what the topic your group choose, your group need formula at least one key research question, find data to answer that question by using the quantitative methods, and present those results for educated public consumption. The presentation should include the following:\n\nAn introduction to the research question\nAn overview of the data, including its source, collection method, and any relevant background information\nAn overview of the methods used\nA discussion of the results\nA brief discussion of the implications of the research for theory, policy or practice\nA conclusion\nA brief discussion of the limitations of the study (optional)\nA brief discussion of the future directions of the research (optional)"
