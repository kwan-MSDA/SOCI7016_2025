## Course objectives

In this course, you will learn the basics of quantitative methods as applied to the social sciences. This involves two broad skill sets. First, a good command of the conceptual foundations of statistics is essential to understand why social scientists analyze data in some specific ways. Second, a hands-on experience in the computing and programming tools (R in our course) to both manage and analyze data is crucial to be able to apply the conceptual foundations of statistics to real-world data.

## Course learning outcomes

At the end of the course you should be able to:

+ Use R for data analysis
+ Summarize and visualize data
+ Wrangle data into tidy forms
+ Understand the basic concepts of probability and statistics
+ Quantify uncertainty in data analysis
+ Be able to use regression models to analyze data

## Assessment Strategies (tentative)

+ Class participation (10%)
+ **Midterm exam** (40%)
+ Group Final project (50%)
  + proposal (10%)
  + presentation (20%)
  + a blog/website (20%)

## Midterm exam

The midterm exam will be on Nov 19th. It will last 150 mins. It will cover all the materials covered in the syllabus and it will be a in-class exam. If you miss it, you will fail in this part. You will not be allowed to collaborate with other students or be able to communicate with any humans/AI/Internets about the exam. More information about the exam will be provided as it approaches.

## Group Final project presentation

Each group will have a group of 3 students, with plus/minus 1 flexibility. If you really want to do an individual project, please seek my approval first.

This is a `data analysis` project about a particular topic excites your group. No matter what the topic your group choose, your group need formula at least one key research question, find data to answer that question by using quantitative methods, and present those results for educated population.

1. A proposal (submission due: Nov 5th 5pm in Moodle)
  + write a short (one-page) proposal
  + state your research question
  + why this question is "interesting"
  + formulate a hypothesis related to the research question
  + where you will get the data to test the hypothesis

<!--

+ Describe your explanatory variable(s) of interest and how it is measured
  + need to observe variation in this variable in order to study it
+ Describe your outcome variable of interest and how it is measured
+ What observed pattern in the data would provide support for your hypothesis?
+ More importantly, what observed pattern would disprove your hypothesis?

-->

2. The final project presentation 

It is an opportunity for you to present your final project to the class.  The presentation should include the following:

+ An introduction to the research question
+ An overview of the data, including its source, collection method, and any relevant background information
+ An overview of the methods used
+ visualization of the results
+ A brief discussion of the implications of the research for theory, policy or practice
+ A conclusion
+ A brief discussion of the limitations of the study (optional)
+ A brief discussion of the future directions of the research (optional)

<!--
+ To earn full credit on the visualizations and regression output, they should use informative labels and names and have a small number of digits presented

+ Tables should use kable or modelsummary to format output nicely
-->

3. A blog/website

+ Present and interpret your findings in a blog not more than 800 words and attached
with at least 3 visualization of data and results

+ published electronically online
  e.g. [Medium](https://medium.com/), [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Github blog](https://github.blog/) or other online public platform.

## Textbooks and Reference

I will draw materials from the following books in this course:

+ Imai, Kosuke and Nora Webb Willaims. 2022. Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction with Tidyverse, 2022. Princeton University Press.

+ Ismay, Chester and Albert Y. Kim. 2022. Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse.


## Late Policy

+ For problem sets, late submissions will be penalized two sub-grade if submitted 0-24 hours late and penalized 4 sub-grade if submitted 24-48 hours late. We will not accept any submissions after 48 hours --- we will get F for the assignment.

## Academic honesty and plagiarism

The university has high expectations for ethical conduct among students. Students must always pursue academic honesty in their studies, as this is a condition for authentic learning and creative intellectual contributions. Committing the following (including but not limited to) dishonest behaviour is unacceptable in any circumstances:


+ Plagiarism (i.e. use of other people’s work without proper acknowledgement);

+ Submitting an assignment that is not the student’s own work, including the use of prior students’ work

+ Forgery of any document or certificate


Please be reminded that disciplinary actions in connection with the violation of academic honesty may result in serious consequences. Plagiarism may be handled by the individual teacher or reported to the University Disciplinary Committee.
